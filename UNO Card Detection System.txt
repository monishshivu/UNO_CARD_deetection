>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>UNO Card Detection System
This project implements a real-time UNO card detection system using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. It utilizes a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect the number on the cards and applies color detection algorithms based on the HSV color space to recognize the card's color.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Features
Real-Time Number Detection: Uses a CNN model to detect numbers on UNO cards.
Color Detection: Detects the color of UNO cards using HSV color space.
Webcam Integration: Real-time detection through a standard webcam.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Prerequisites
Before you run this project, you will need the following:

download anaconda from the given link

https://www.anaconda.com/download
 
Install Required Libraries
bash
<<<<
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file should contain:
<<<<
numpy
opencv-python
matplotlib
tensorflow
Usage
To run the UNO card detection system, execute the script uno_card_detector.py:
<<<<<
bash
Copy code
python uno_card_detector.py
The script will activate your webcam. Show UNO cards to the webcam. The detected color and number will be displayed in real-time on the video feed. Press 'q' to quit the application.

<<<<<<<<Project Structure
uno_card_detector.ipynb: Main script to start the webcam and process the video feed.
models/: Directory containing the trained TensorFlow model.
utils/: Contains utility scripts for image processing and color detection.
Model Training
Details about training the model are not included in this project. If you need to train the model:
<<<<<<
Collect a dataset of UNO cards with labeled images.
Use a CNN architecture to train the model for number recognition.
Save the trained model in the models/ directory.

Notes
Adjust the repository URL and any specific paths or filenames as per your project's actual setup.
If you have specific instructions or scripts for training the model, include those details in the README or link to additional documentation or scripts.
Always ensure to include a license for your open source projects; MIT is a common choice, but choose what fits your needs best.
This README should give users all the information they need to set up, run, and understand the basic functionality of your UNO card detection project.
